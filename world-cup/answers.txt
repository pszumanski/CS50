Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations times does not increase linearly with increase in simulations



Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would call 10000 simulation predictions "good enough" because they vary slightly when compared to more simulations, which take (relatively) much more time
to compute. This amount simulations shows a good picture of what can be expected without any random ranking swaps
