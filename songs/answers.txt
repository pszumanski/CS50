1) I would calculate weighted average, where the top1 song is the most impactful and top100 the least
2) It might not be representative of the listener, because, for example, a listener could have played their top songs in one mood, but have listened to much more songs
in different mood with higher listening time overall, therefore it might not be their most listened to mood. Better way to calculate the aura of a listener would be to
look at all played songs and calculate time spent in given aura.
