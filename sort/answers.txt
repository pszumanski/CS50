sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: its instantenous when the array if sorted (no swaps made makes program quit early), however in other cases its speed is largely affected by number of elements in the array

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: its speed is barely affected by increase in number of elements and is not changed by sorted, reversed nor random array

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: its speed is largely affected by number of elements in the array, however its speed doesnt increase when given an already sorted array
